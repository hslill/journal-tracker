Exporting ISSNs from Alma

export your library’s journal ISSNs using a report or bibliographic export. Here’s a step-by-step guide for creating a .txt or CSV file:

Step 1: Log in to Alma

Go to your Alma instance: e.g., https://YOURLIBRARY.alma.exlibrisgroup.com.

Log in with your librarian or catalog manager credentials.

Step 2: Open Analytics / Reports

Alma has a Reports/Analytics tool for exports.

Go to Analytics (may be under Resources → Analytics or Reports depending on your role).

Choose the "Serials" or "Electronic Resources" subject area — these areas usually contain journal/serial metadata.

You want a dataset that contains at least:

ISSN

Journal Title

Optional: Publisher, e-ISSN, Print/Online indicator

Step 3: Create a Query / Report

Create a new query (or report) in Analytics.

Add the fields:

MMS ID (optional)

Journal Title

ISSN

Filter if desired (e.g., only clinical journals, if you have a subject code or collection tag).

Preview results to make sure you’re getting all journals.

Step 4: Export the Data

In Analytics, click Export.

Choose a format:

CSV → easiest for later conversion to JSON

TXT → fine if you only need ISSNs

Save the file locally, e.g., alma_issns.csv or alma_issns.txt.

Step 5: Check the File

If CSV, it might look like:

Title,ISSN
Journal of Clinical Studies,2044-7248
Another Clinical Journal,1234-5678


If TXT, you can have either one ISSN per line, or ISSN|Title for each journal.



ADDITIONAL NOTES:
With that many records, we need to plan carefully so it’s manageable and performant for your title-change tracker.

Here’s how you can handle it:

1️⃣ Split the Export into Chunks

Alma Analytics has export limits (usually 1,000–2,000 rows per CSV).

Strategy: export by collection, subject, or type (e.g., clinical journals only).

This way you don’t process hundreds of thousands of unnecessary titles, and your app only tracks journals you actually care about.

2️⃣ Filter to Clinical Titles Before Export

Use Alma’s subject codes, collection filters, or tags.

Only export journals classified as medicine/clinical.

This can reduce the list from 500k to a few thousand — much more practical.

3️⃣ Avoid Storing Everything in Memory

Even filtered, several thousand journals can get big. Use:

Streaming CSV parsing (Node.js: csv-parser, Python: pandas.read_csv with chunks)

Incremental JSON updates: don’t load all titles in memory at once; process line by line.

4️⃣ Automation Approach

Export clinical journals in batches from Alma to CSV/TXT.

Parse CSV in a Node.js script: extract ISSN and Title → save into journals.json.

Monthly updates:

Fetch current title via Ulrichsweb for each ISSN.
