How it works.

DD Question:
Let's start with this initial output table:
18784046	Academic Radiology	Academic Radiology	Unchanged

If tomorrow, let's say, BrowZine changes Academic Radiology to Academic Radiological Society Journal, and I come to my pc and decide to run index.html, what should I expect?


ChatGPT said:

If BrowZine changes the journal’s title tomorrow, here’s what will happen when you run your updated index.html:

Node server fetches the latest data from BrowZine when you hit /alljournals.

title will now be "Academic Radiological Society Journal".

oldTitle will still be "Academic Radiology" in journals.json.

Browser fetches /alljournals via fetchJournals().

Comparison occurs:

previousTitle = oldTitle = "Academic Radiology".

title = "Academic Radiological Society Journal".

changed = true because title !== previousTitle.

Rendering:

The row will now show:

ISSN           Title                                      Previous Title       Status
18784046       Academic Radiological Society Journal      Academic Radiology  Updated


The row will be highlighted with the .changed class (yellow background).

Next update (after you or the server run checkTitleChanges):

oldTitle in journals.json will be updated to match the new title.

On subsequent loads, the row will show as Unchanged until another BrowZine change occurs.

So essentially, the tracker detects any title change immediately, highlights it, and then updates oldTitle to remember the new title for future comparisons.
